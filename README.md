# Fine-Tuning a Language Model using LoRA

This repository demonstrates the fine-tuning of a pre-trained language model for sentiment analysis using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The project focuses on efficiently adapting a model for a specific task while minimizing computational and memory overhead.

## Project Overview

In this project, we fine-tune a pre-trained language model on a sentiment analysis task using the IMDb movie reviews dataset. The technique employed, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), allows for efficient model adaptation by reducing the number of trainable parameters, making it particularly suitable for scenarios with limited computational resources.

### Key Features

- **Efficient Fine-Tuning with LoRA:** Adapts the model without full retraining, leveraging LoRA to minimize resource usage.
- **Custom Dataset Handling:** Prepares and processes a subset of the IMDb dataset, saving it locally for reuse.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Assesses model performance on a validation set with relevant metrics.

## What is LoRA?

### Overview

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a technique designed to fine-tune large pre-trained models efficiently. Instead of updating all the parameters of a model during fine-tuning, LoRA inserts trainable, low-rank matrices into each layer of the transformer architecture. These matrices are specifically designed to capture task-specific adjustments while keeping the majority of the model's parameters frozen. This approach significantly reduces the computational cost and memory requirements, enabling more accessible fine-tuning, even on large models.

### How LoRA Works

1. **Parameter Decomposition:** LoRA decomposes the weight updates into low-rank matrices. Instead of directly updating the full weight matrix of a layer, LoRA approximates the update as a product of two low-rank matrices. This reduces the number of trainable parameters from \(O(n^2)\) to \(O(n \times r)\), where \(r\) is the rank of the matrices and is much smaller than \(n\).

2. **Insertion into Model Layers:** These low-rank matrices are inserted into the transformer layers, typically in the attention blocks. The original weights of the model are kept frozen during training, and only the low-rank matrices are trained. This allows the model to adapt to the new task without altering its pre-trained knowledge.

3. **Training Efficiency:** By reducing the number of parameters that need to be updated, LoRA not only saves memory but also speeds up training. This makes it possible to fine-tune large models on consumer-grade hardware.

4. **Inference:** During inference, the low-rank updates are integrated with the original model weights, enabling the model to perform the task with the benefits of the fine-tuning, without additional computational overhead.

## Repository Structure

- **`LoRA_fine-tuning.ipynb`:** The main notebook containing the code for dataset preparation, model fine-tuning using LoRA, and evaluation.
- **`data/`:** Directory where the processed dataset is stored after being saved from the notebook.
- **`model/`:** Directory where the checkpoints of the trained model is stored.

## Steps in the Notebook

### 1. Imports and Environment Setup

- **Libraries:** Essential libraries are imported, including `datasets`, `transformers`, `peft`, and others.
- **Warnings Suppression:** Warnings are suppressed for a cleaner output, ensuring focus on the main tasks.

### 2. Dataset Preparation

- **Dataset Loading:** The IMDb dataset is loaded using the `datasets` library.
- **Subsampling:** A random subsample of 10,000 examples is generated for both training and validation.
- **Saving the Dataset:** The processed dataset is saved locally for reuse in the fine-tuning process.

### 3. Model Fine-Tuning with LoRA

- **Model Configuration:**
  - The notebook configures a pre-trained language model for sequence classification using `AutoModelForSequenceClassification`.
  - LoRA is applied by creating low-rank matrices and integrating them into the model layers.
- **Training Process:**
  - The model is fine-tuned on the subsampled IMDb dataset.
  - Training arguments are set up to optimize the fine-tuning process with respect to performance and resource usage.

### 4. Evaluation

- **Model Performance:** The fine-tuned model's performance is evaluated on the validation set.
- **Metrics:** Standard classification metrics are used to assess the effectiveness of the LoRA fine-tuning approach.

## Future Work

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiment with different ranks for the low-rank matrices to further optimize model performance.
- **Expand Dataset:** Use a larger dataset or additional data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.
- **Advanced Metrics:** Incorporate metrics like F1-score, Precision, and Recall for a more detailed evaluation.
